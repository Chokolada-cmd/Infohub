<h5 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif';font-size: 30px;">We provide a 6-week training program</h5>
<br><br>
<p>What is a Paradigm shift? It is a change in the student's perspective.</p>
<p>At Institute of Mathematics we have a firm belief that for rapid change in results there must be a change in how you see reality. I want to change your perspective on how we learn and input information. Not through our eyes and ears but our intuition and imagination.</p>
<p>We want to suggest that beyond seeing, hearing and studying there are higher faculties that students must observe and manipulate in order to succeed. The 6 mental higher facalties are Reason, Imagination, Intuition, Perception, Memory and Will. The one important faculty of use in the journey to success is Imagination. With imagination the world was created. Religious books tell us man was created in God's image. What is this image? It is the imagination of God. We also have the same power and spirit within us. Imagine yourself a top acheiver.</p>
<p>Imagine yourself great, see yourself in the mind, picture greatness, be a visionery. We will teach you how to excersise this mental faculty of imagination. We plant pictures into your mind, see yourself getting distinctions in most subjects. Picture yourself receiving that award at school for high mark achiever, see yourself as a Top 10 learner in your grade. Imagine yourself smashing each and every test and exams.<p>
<p>We also teach how to set goals and acheive them. We believe you are a goal creator!</p>
